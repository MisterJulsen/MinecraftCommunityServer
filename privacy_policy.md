# Privacy Policy

We do not actively collect personal data. However, certain technical and user-generated information is automatically processed and stored to ensure the server's functionality and offer all features. This includes:

- Minecraft Username and UUID: Required for player identification in the game.
- IP Address: Temporarily processed to establish and secure connections to the server.
- Server Log Data: Information such as login/logout times, all chat messages (private, public) and error messages.
- User-Generated Content (e.g. sounds, images): Players have the option to upload custom sounds and images for use in the game. These files are stored as part of the game world and will be included in the public world download. DO NOT UPLOAD CONTENT THAT CONTAINS ANY PERSONAL DATA!

We do not share any private data (such as IP addresses or chat messages) with third parties. However, any user-generated content, including custom sounds, images, your UUID and your player data (inventory, advancements, etc.) will be publicly accessible as part of downloadable game world.
By joining the server you agree to these terms.

### Data Retention
Technical data such as server logs are regularly deleted and only kept as long as necessary for server maintenance.
User-generated content is retained in the game world unless removed by the player.
Once the server is finished, all personal data collected by us will be irrevocably deleted, with the exception of all data that players left on the server by themselves.

### Your Rights
As a player, you have the right to:

- Access Information: Request details about any data stored in connection with your account.
- Deletion: Request removal of stored data where technically possible. Note that removing user-generated content may have a detrimental effect on your creations on the server world! (e.g. missing sounds or images)

To exercise these rights or for any questions, please contact us on Discord with a private support ticket or via mrjulsen@gmail.com

### Changes to this Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in server operations or legal requirements. We will inform you about important changes on the server and in Discord.
