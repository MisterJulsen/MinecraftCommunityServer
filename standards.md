# Standards
> [!NOTE]
> These standards only apply for the public infrastructure and builds! Everything in your private area (e.g. subway, tram) are excluded from this.
> After asking for permission, exceptions in the public are also possible (e.g. narrow-gage routes, train stations that are designed for it).

## Public Railways

> [!CAUTION]
> Never send trains on tracks that the train is not suitable for. For example, trains that are too wide can cause massive damage along the entire route!

## Public roads
- ### Traffic Side
  right-hand traffic
- ### Road Width (two lanes)
  7 or 9 blocks on high-speed roads

## Our recommendations
- ### Minimum distance to other players/groups
  around 1000 blocks
- ### Public energy production
  Instead of each player building their own energy production, multiple players can use one power source that produces enough output and is connected the players with power lines.
- ### Energy Transportation
  Use overhead power lines to transport electricity over longer distances, because it is more aesthetic.
