# Global Rail Network Guidelines
One goal of the server is to build a public rail network that connects the entire world like in real-life countries. Here are a few basic guidelines to make this possible.

> [!WARNING]
> We have set the max train speed to 300 km/h (even in curves) in the Config. **PLEASE set the max speed of EVERY train and EVERY track according to the speed guidelines mentioned below!**

- ### Coordination
  Keep up to the [standards](https://github.com/MisterJulsen/MinecraftCommunityServer/blob/main/standards.md) and make sure existing rail traffic is not affected when extending the network (e.g. new track, new train). If in doubt, ask Server Staff or Trusted Players. Use `#public-railways` in discord to discuss.
- ### Stay realistic
  No tight curves, unrealistic track switches, overlapping tracks (crossings excluded), steep climbs/descents, floating tracks
- ### Exceptions
  Exceptions are possible at any time, but should be clarified with the affected players or the Server Staff (e.g. before building a new/special track at a train station)
- ### New routes
  Use existing infrastructure if available, before building new routes.
- ### New Scheduled trains
  Before sending a scheduled train onto the rail network, make sure not to cause any problems on the route (e.g. blocking other trains with long waiting times) and the desired route is not already operated by other trains (Overcrowding). If in doubt, ask Server Staff or Trusted Players.
- ### Trusted Players
  Players who already have experience in the public rail network and make responsible decisions. Every player can reach this status.
- ### Private rail networks
  Do not build a private rail network next to the public in a similar scale (local subway/tram/train network excluded). Instead, expand the public network.
- ### Train Speed
  Every train on the public rail network must specify the maximum speed of its category at the beginning of the schedule. (e.g. 50% for regional trains) [You can find exact values ​​in the standards.](https://github.com/MisterJulsen/MinecraftCommunityServer/blob/main/standards.md)
  For that use the "Set Primary Speed Limit"instruction at the start of the schedule as shown:

- ### Train Dissasemblng
  Dissasemble trains only at private rail yards to avoid trains braking platform edges and blocking tracks.

- ### Track Speed
  On each route, the maximum track speed **MUST** be set (independently of the trains) by train signs, depending on the environment (e.g. straight track, curved track). Before curves, the speed must also be temporarily reduced. There are no specific values, it is done by eye and what feels realistic. For basic routes, we recommend 50%, on straight high-speed routes, 100% can be used.
> [!NOTE]
> You can use the track speed that is shown when placing track curves, this can be helpful but not a requierment.
