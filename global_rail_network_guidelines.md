# Global Rail Network Guidelines
One goal of the server is to build a public rail network that connects the entire world like in real-life countries. Here are a few basic guidelines to make this possible.

- ### Coordination
  Keep up to the [standards](https://github.com/MisterJulsen/MinecraftCommunityServer/blob/main/standards.md) and make sure existing rail traffic is not affected when extending the network (e.g. new track, new train). If in doubt, ask Server Staff or Trusted Players. Use `#public-railways` in discord.
- ### Stay realistic
  No tight curves, unrealistic track switches, overlapping tracks (crossings excluded), steep climbs/descents, floating tracks
- ### Exceptions
  Exceptions are possible at any time, but should be clarified with the affected players or the Server Staff (e.g. before building a special track at a train station)
- ### New routes
  Use existing infrastructure if available, before building new routes.
- ### New Scheduled trains
  Before sending a scheduled train onto the rail network, make sure not to cause any problems on the route (e.g. blocking other trains with long waiting times) and the desired route is not already operated by other trains (Overcrowding). If in doubt, ask Server Staff or Trusted Players.
- ### Trusted Players
  Players who already have experience in the public rail network and make responsible decisions. Every player can reach this status.
- ### Private track networks
  Do not build a private track network next to the public in a similar scale. Instead, expand the public network.
