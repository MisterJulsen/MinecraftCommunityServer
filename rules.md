# Community Server Rules

> [!NOTE]
> This list of rules will be incomplete and may not cover all situations. The server management will take action in some special cases, even if this is not clearly stated here.
> We may change any of these rules in the future and will let you know after a rule has been changed, once the server has launched.

## General Rules
- ### Respect and fairness
  Treat all players with respect and kindness. Insults, discrimination or bullying are strictly prohibited! Also, keep enough distance from other players if you want to build something on your own, to avoid crowding them.
- ### No questionable content
  Do nothing that is offensive, obscene or otherwise inappropriate.
- ### Griefing and theft
  Modifying or looting someone else's property or items is not allowed.
- ### No cheating or exploits
  Don't use modifications, hacks or exploits that give you or other players an unfair advantage. If unsure, please ask.
- ### Communication
  Follow the server staff's instructions and use the chat respectfully. Spam, excessive cursing and advertising are prohibited. Use English as the main language.
- ### Groups, guilds, nations
  You can create your own guilds and nations and even use your own language there. Please provide English texts (e.g. on signs) in areas that may be important for the public (e.g. train stations).
- ### Resource collection
  Use the `farm world` to collect resources on a larger scale (e.g. Digital Miner from Mekanism). Avoid destroying the landscape in the central area.
- ### Dangerous and Destructive Features
  Be careful when using dangerous machines (e.g. Fission Reactor from Mekanism). Keep enough distance from civilization.

## Private areas

> [!NOTE]
> **DEFINITION:** All locations claimed by an individual or a group, clearly marked as private property or areas that are enclosed (e.g. with signs or fences) and are not intended for public use (e.g. tram network of a city).

- ### Freedom to build
  Players can build whatever they want in their private areas as long as it doesn't violate other server rules.
- ### Marking of private areas
  Private areas should be marked (e.g. with signs or fences) so that other players know which areas are already occupied. We reserve the right to release claimed areas, e.g. if an area is not actively used for a long time or if it is important for the infrastructure.
- ### Privacy protection
  Only enter locked-off/private areas with the permission of the owner.

## Public areas

> [!NOTE]
> **DEFINITION:** All locations that are accessible or intended for public usage or are connected to the server's global infrastructure (e.g. road, rail).

- ### Usage
  Public areas should be accessible to all players. Respect the existing infrastructure and buildings and do not change anything without permission. Avoid destruction!
- ### Coordination
  Major changes or construction projects in public areas (e.g. highway roads, train stations) must be coordinated with the community or the server staff.
- ### Design and functionality
  Structures in public areas should be accessible and aesthetically pleasing. Chaos, destruction and uncoordinated constructions must be avoided.
- ### Connection to infrastructure
  All public buildings (e.g. train stations, bridges) that are connected to the public infrastructure (especially the public rail network) must be approved by responsible authorities or the server staff.
  
## Server resource usage

> [!WARNING]
> The server staff reserves the right to unload chunks or disable resource-intensive machines/constructions if causing the performance issues.

- ### Chunk loading
  Chunkloaders are allowed, use them sparingly.
- ### Machines
  Switch off machines that don't need to run permanently or that cause high resource usage!
- ### Entities
  Use as few entities as possible. Minimize the usage of villagers!
- ### Block Entities
  Reduce Block Entities. Avoid long cable connections with blocks, use overhead wires (e.g. Immersive Engineering) instead.
- ### Crashing the server
  Please do not intentionally crash the server. Mistakes can happen.

## Public Railways

> [!NOTE]
> These rules only apply to the public rail network! Railway lines in your private area (e.g. subway, tram) are excluded from this.

- ### Coordination
  Don't build or modify railway lines and stations without permission. Where public rail infrastructure is available, it should be used, instead of constructing a new (private) line. Modifications that do not affect the rail traffic can be conducted without approval. Only build as many tracks as necessary (please no stations with 100 tracks!)
- ### Ownership of public rail lines
  Public Railway infrastructure and stations will be managed by the server staff by default, to better coordinate building, upgrading and scheduling. Of course everyone is welcome to be part of it and help expand the public rail infrastructure when asking.
- ### Use public railway lines
  Do not send scheduled trains onto the public rail network without permission. The train schedule must be approved to ensure that other trains or stations are not blocked. Manual individual journeys are permitted at any time.
- ### Stay realistic
  No tight curves, unrealistic track switches areas, overlapping railway lines, steep climbs/descents, floating tracks
- ### Signaling
  Place signals where necessary and ensure that tracks are separated from each other by signals (e.g. at switches). Don't place too many signals (e.g. every 5 blocks) but also don't leave too large sections unsignalled (reduces capacity). One signal every 100 - 150 blocks might be a good reference.
- ### Parking trains
  Park trains in the depot and never on the open tracks.
- ### Other players' trains
  Do not use or modify other players' trains without permission.
- ### Disassemble trains
  Disassemble trains that you don't need, to save server performance. The server staff reserves the right to do this if performance issues arise.

## Public Railways Standards
> [!NOTE]
> These standards only apply to the public rail network! Railway lines in your private area (e.g. subway, tram) are excluded from this.
> After asking for permission, exceptions in the public rail network are also possible on special routes (e.g. narrow-gauge routes) and train stations that are designed for it.

> [!CAUTION]
> Never send trains on tracks that the train is not suitable for. For example, trains that are too wide can cause massive damage along the entire route!

- ### Side
  right-hand traffic
- ### Platform and boarding height
  2 blocks
- ### Platform distance to the tracks
  at least 0.5 blocks
- ### Distance between tracks
  2 blocks
- ### Train dimensions
  - Width: 3 blocks interior + max. 0.5 block walls on the sides  
  - Height: max. 7 blocks
  - Train length: max. 300 blocks
  - Carriage length: max. 30 blocks

## Our recommendations
- ### Minimum distance to other players/groups
  around 1000 blocks
- ### Default road width (two lanes)
  7 blocks, 9 blocks on high-speed roads
- ### Public energy production
  Instead of each player building their own energy production, several players can use one power source that produces enough output and is connected the players with power lines.

## Content Creation
> [!NOTE]
> Streaming or recording gameplay (e.g. on YouTube or Twitch) is permitted.

- Protect the privacy of other players
- Never link the IP or other information directly, instead refer to the Discord server
- Use the command `/trigger live` to enable/disable the streaming mode so other players can see that you are live
- We cannot guarantee that no copyright content (e.g. pictures or music) will be in your stream/video
- Don't intentionally break the rules to generate clicks. Abusing a ban for clicks will result in a permanent ban!
- Leave credit (e.g. in the video description) that this is a Minecraft Community Server from MrJulsen's Modding Community
