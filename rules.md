# Community Server Rules

> [!NOTE]
> This list of rules will be incomplete and may not cover all situations. The server management will take action in some special cases, even if this is not clearly stated here.
> We may change any of these rules in the future and will let you know after a rule has been changed, once the server has launched.

## General Rules
- ### Respect and fairness
  Treat all players with respect and kindness. Insults, discrimination or bullying are strictly prohibited! Also, keep enough distance from other players if you want to build something on your own, to avoid crowding them.
- ### No offensive content
  Do nothing that is offensive, obscene or otherwise inappropriate.
- ### Griefing and theft
  Modifying or looting someone else's property or items is not allowed.
- ### No cheating or exploits
  Don't use modifications, hacks or exploits that give you or other players an unfair advantage. If unsure, please ask.
- ### Communication
  Follow the server staff's instructions and use the chat respectfully. Spam, excessive cursing and advertising are prohibited. Use English as the main language.
- ### Groups, guilds, nations
  You can create your own guilds and nations and even use your own language there. Please provide English texts (e.g. on signs) in areas that may be important for the public (e.g. train stations).
- ### Resource collection
  Use the farm world to collect resources on a larger scale (e.g. Digital Miner from Mekanism). Avoid destroying the landscape in the central area. The farm world can be accessed at spawn.
- ### Dangerous and Destructive Features
  Be careful when using dangerous features (e.g. Fission Reactor from Mekanism). Keep enough distance from civilization.

## Private areas
- ### Freedom to build
  Players can build whatever they want in their private areas as long as it doesn't violate other server rules.
- ### Marking of private areas
  Claim private areas to protect your property. Make sure that everything that is intended for public (e.g. your train station) can be used correctly by other players. ([Use sub-claims in Open Claims and Parties for this](https://youtu.be/RB-yYwxDjPY?si=aH6wsHtVain1jd5M&t=62))
- ### Privacy protection
  Only enter locked-off/private areas with the permission of the owner.

## Public areas
- ### Usage
  Public areas should be accessible to all players. Respect the existing infrastructure and buildings and do not change anything without permission. Avoid chaos and destruction!
- ### Coordination
  Major changes or large construction projects in public areas (e.g. highway roads, train stations) must be coordinated with the surrounding players or the server staff.
- ### Design and functionality
  Structures in public areas should be accessible and aesthetically pleasing. You may claim it to prevent destruction, but make sure other players can use it as intended. ([Use sub-claims in Open Claims and Parties for this](https://youtu.be/RB-yYwxDjPY?si=aH6wsHtVain1jd5M&t=62))
- ### Spawn
  Spawn area is community area! Players are not allowed to claim the entire area for themselves. Use this area for shops, events, etc.
  
## Server resource usage
> [!WARNING]
> The server staff reserves the right to unload chunks or disable resource-intensive machines/constructions if this causes performance issues.

- ### Chunk loading
  Chunkloaders are allowed, use them sparingly.
- ### Machines
  Switch off machines that don't need to run permanently or that cause high server-resource usage!
- ### Entities
  Use as few entities as possible. Minimize the usage of villagers!
- ### Block Entities
  Reduce Block Entities. Avoid long cable connections with blocks, use overhead wires (e.g. Immersive Engineering) instead.
- ### Crashing the server
  Please do not intentionally crash the server. Mistakes can happen.

## Railways

> [!TIP]
> We would like to build a [large global rail network](https://github.com/MisterJulsen/MinecraftCommunityServer/blob/main/global_rail_network_guidelines.md).

- ### Scale
  Only build as many tracks as necessary (please no stations with 50 tracks because you _can_)
- ### Signaling
  Place signals where necessary and ensure that tracks are separated from each other by signals (e.g. at switches). Don't place too many signals (e.g. every 5 blocks) but also don't leave too large sections unsignalled (reduces capacity). One signal every ~150 blocks might be a good reference.
- ### Parking trains
  Park trains in the depot and never on the open tracks.
- ### Other players' trains
  Do not use or modify other players' trains without permission.
- ### Disassemble trains
  Disassemble trains that you don't need, to save server performance. The server staff reserves the right to do this if performance issues arise.
- ### Max Speed
  [Please follow these guidelines for public rail network speed limits](https://github.com/MisterJulsen/MinecraftCommunityServer/blob/main/global_rail_network_guidelines.md#train-speed), since we have set the max speed to 300 km/h.

## Content Creation
> [!NOTE]
> Streaming or recording gameplay (e.g. on YouTube or Twitch) is permitted.

- Protect the privacy of other players
- Never link the IP or other information directly, instead refer to the Discord server
- Use the command `/trigger live` to enable/disable the streaming mode so other players can see that you are live
- We cannot guarantee that no copyright content (e.g. pictures or music) will be shown in your stream/video
- Don't intentionally break the rules to generate clicks. Abusing a ban for clicks will result in a permanent ban!
