# Community Server Rules

> [!NOTE]
> This list of rules may be incomplete and may not cover all situations. The server management may take action in some special cases, even if this is not clearly stated here.

> [!NOTE]
> We may change any of these rules in the future. We will you know after a rule has been changed.

## General Rules
- ### Respect and fairness
  Treat all players with respect and kindness. Insults, discrimination or bullying are strictly prohibited! Also, keep enough distance from other players' areas to avoid crowding them unless otherwise agreed. (We recommend at least 1000 blocks)
- ### No questionable content
  Structures or content that are offensive, obscene or otherwise inappropriate are prohibited.
- ### Griefing and theft
  Changing or looting someone else's property or items is not permitted.
- ### No cheating or exploits
  Do not use modifications, hacks or exploits that give you or other players an unfair advantage. Violation will be punished immediately with a permanent ban!
- ### Communication
  Follow the server management's instructions and use the chat respectfully. Spam and excessive cursing and advertising are prohibited. Texts in public areas should preferably be written in English or combined with an English translation. (e.g. Hauptbahnhof _(Main Train Station)_)
- ### Report rule violations
  You can help ensure that the server remains a peaceful place for everyone! Please report any violations you notice or if you personally don't like something. We can then try to resolve the dispute or intervene appropriately.
- ### Groupings
  Groups are permitted and welcome. You can create your own nations, to which several players can belong. In public areas, important texts (e.g. navigation signs) should be written in English (except for proper names)
## Pprivate areas
- ### Freedom to build
  Players can build whatever they want in their private areas as long as it doesn't violate other server rules.
- ### Marking of private areas
  Private areas should be clearly marked (e.g. with signs or fences) so that other players know which areas are already occupied. We reserve the right to release occupied areas, e.g. if an area is not actively used for a long time or if it is important for the infrastructure.
- ### Privacy protection
  Only enter locked-off/private areas with the permission of the owner.
## Public areas
- ### Usage
  Public areas are accessible to all players. Respect the existing infrastructure and structures and do not change anything without consultation.
- ### Coordination
  Major changes or construction projects in public areas (e.g. streets, train stations) must be coordinated in advance with the community or the server management.
- ### Design and functionality
  Structures in public areas should be practical, accessible and aesthetically pleasing. Chaos, destruction and uncoordinated constructions must be avoided.
- ### Connection to infrastructure
  All public buildings (e.g. train stations, bridges) that are to be connected to the public infrastructure, especially if it is a functioning and sensitive system (e.g. public rail network), must first be communicated with the responsible authorities or the server management must be clearly agreed upon and must not be blocked.
## Server resource usage

> [!WARNING]
> The server management reserves the right to unload loaded chunks or disable resource-intensive machines/constructions if this improves the server performance.

- ### Chunk loading
  Chunloaders are allowed, but should be used very sparingly.
- ### Machines
  Please switch off machines that do not need to be permanently active or that lead to high resource usage!
- ### Entities
  Optimize your farms and use as few entities as possible. The use of villagers should be **minimized**. (Even four cows are enough for enough meat and leather in the long run)
## Our recommendations
- ### Minimum distance to other players
  1000 Blocks
## Definitions
- ### Public area
  All locations that are accessible for public usage or connected to the server's global infrastructure (e.g., road, rail, or pathway networks). This includes train stations, markets, central paths, and public bridges.
- ### Private area
  All locations claimed by an individual or group, clearly marked as private property or enclosed (e.g., with signs or fences), and not intended for general use (e.g. tram network of a city).
