# Community Server Rules

> [!NOTE]
> This list of rules will be incomplete and may not cover all situations. The server management will take action in some special cases, even if this is not clearly stated here.
> We may change any of these rules in the future and will let you know after a rule has been changed, once the server has launched.

## General Rules
- ### Respect and fairness
  Treat all players with respect and kindness. Insults, discrimination or bullying are strictly prohibited! Also, keep enough distance from other players' areas to avoid crowding them unless otherwise agreed. (We recommend at least 1000 blocks)
- ### No questionable content
  Structures or content that are offensive, obscene or otherwise inappropriate are prohibited.
- ### Griefing and theft
  Changing or looting someone else's property or items is not permitted.
- ### No cheating or exploits
  Do not use modifications, hacks or exploits that give you or other players an unfair advantage. Violation will be punished. If unsure, please ask.
- ### Communication
  Follow the server management's instructions and use the chat respectfully. Spam and excessive cursing and advertising are prohibited. Use English as the main language.
- ### Report rule violations
  You can help ensure that the server remains a peaceful place for everyone! Please report any violations you notice or if you personally don't like something. We can then try to resolve the dispute or intervene appropriately.
- ### Groups, guilds, nations
  You can create your own guilds and nations and even use your own language there, but please also provide English texts (e.g. on signs) in areas that may be important for the public (e.g. train stations).

## Private areas

> [!NOTE]
> **DEFINITION:** All locations claimed by an individual or group, clearly marked as private property or are enclosed (e.g. with signs or fences) and are not intended for public use (e.g. tram network of a city).

- ### Freedom to build
  Players can build whatever they want in their private areas as long as it doesn't violate other server rules.
- ### Marking of private areas
  Private areas should be clearly marked (e.g. with signs or fences) so that other players know which areas are already occupied. We reserve the right to release occupied areas, e.g. if an area is not actively used for a long time or if it is important for the infrastructure.
- ### Privacy protection
  Only enter locked-off/private areas with the permission of the owner.

## Public areas

> [!NOTE]
> **DEFINITION:** All locations that are accessible or intended for public usage or are connected to the server's global infrastructure (e.g. road, rail).

- ### Usage
  Public areas are accessible to all players. Respect the existing infrastructure and buildings and do not change anything without permission. Avoid destruction!
- ### Coordination
  Major changes or construction projects in public areas (e.g. highway roads, train stations) must be coordinated in advance with the community or the server management.
- ### Design and functionality
  Structures in public areas should be accessible and aesthetically pleasing. Chaos, destruction and uncoordinated constructions must be avoided.
- ### Connection to infrastructure
  All public buildings (e.g. train stations, bridges) that should be connected to the public infrastructure, especially if it is a global and sensitive system (like the public rail network), must first be communicated with the responsible authorities or the server management.
  
## Server resource usage

> [!WARNING]
> The server management reserves the right to unload loaded chunks or disable resource-intensive machines/constructions if this improves the server performance.

- ### Chunk loading
  Chunkloaders are allowed, but should be used very sparingly.
- ### Machines
  Please switch off machines that do not need to be permanently active or that lead to high resource usage!
- ### Entities
  Optimize your farms and use as few entities as possible. The use of villagers should be **minimized**!
- ### BlockEntities
  Reduce BlockEntities as much as possible. Avoid long cable connections with blocks and use overhead wires from Immersive Engineering instead, for example. (Only the connectors are BlockEntities there and these wires are more aesthetic anyway)

## Public Railways

> [!NOTE]
> These rules only apply to the public rail network! Railway lines in your private area (e.g. subway, tram) are excluded from this.

- ### Coordination
  Do not build or modify railway lines and stations without permission. _(This is important to prevent that everybody build their own tracks anywhere, a route suddenly having 10 tracks (even if 2 would be enough), and the existing network to be influenced or blocked)_. Where public rail infrastructure is available, it should be used, instead of constructing a new (private) line. Modifications that do not affect the rail traffic can be conducted without approval.
- ### Ownership of public rail lines
  Public Railway infrastructure and stations will be managed by the Server Staff by default, to better coordinate building, upgrading and schedules. Of course everyone is welcome to be part of it and help expand the public rail infrastructure after asking.
- ### Use public railway lines
  Do not send scheduled trains onto the public rail network without permission. The train schedule must be approved to ensure that other trains or stations are not blocked. Manual individual journeys are permitted at any time.
- ### Stay realistic
  No tight curves, unrealistic track switches areas, overlapping railway lines, steep climbs/descents, floating tracks
- ### Signaling
  Place signals where necessary and ensure that tracks are separated from each other by signals (e.g. at switches). Don't place too many signals (e.g. every 5 blocks, because of performance issues) but also don't leave too large sections unsignalled (as this reduces capacity). One signal every 100 - 150 blocks might be a good reference.
- ### Parking trains
  Park trains in the depot and never on the open tracks.
- ### Other players' trains
  Do not use or modify other players' trains without permission.
- ### Disassemble trains
  Disassemble trains that you don't need to save server performance. The server staff reserves the right to do this if this rule is violated and performance issues arise.

## Public Railways Standards
> [!NOTE]
> These standards only apply to the public rail network! Railway lines in your private area (e.g. subway, tram) are excluded from this.
> After asking for permission, exceptions in the public rail network are possible on special routes (e.g. narrow-gauge routes) and train stations that are designed for it.

> [!CAUTION]
> Never send trains on tracks that the train is not suitable for. For example, trains that are too wide can cause massive damage along the entire route!

- ### Platform and boarding height
  2 blocks
- ### Platform distance to the tracks
  at least 0.5 blocks
- ### Distance between tracks
  2 blocks
- ### Train dimensions
  Width: 3 blocks interior + max. 0.5 block walls on the sides
  
  Height: max. 7 blocks

  Train length: max. 300 blocks

  Carriage length: max. 30 blocks

## Our recommendations
- ### Minimum distance to other players/groups
  around 1000 blocks
- ### Default road width (two lanes)
  7 blocks, 9 blocks on high-speed roads
